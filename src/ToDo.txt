**BASICS**
display list is a tree structure(no loop)
leaf node is the display object (usually Bitmap), contains graphics
parent node is the display object container (usually Sprite), contains display objects or containers
display object container extends object
class is also tree structure
each display object can have event listeners, each listener has event type and handler function
only the "new" keyword will create new instances, the variables of the same type are just references
properties and methods belong to each instance, static properties and methods belong to the class and only has one copy (can be accessed anywhere)
static methods can only access static properties
super() is the parent class' constructor method
